  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <h3>Caramelized Soy Chicken</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place all the ingredients for the chicken marinade in a bowl. Mix well to coat the chicken. If time permits, allow the
    chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 425°F, and place an oven rack in the top third of your oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the chicken pieces on the baking sheet, skin side down (or smooth side down), evenly spaced apart. Then place the baking sheet in the preheated oven (upper third).
    </li>
    <li>
      Let the chicken roast for 15 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, mix the brown sugar and dark soy sauce for the glaze, and start making the ramen.
    </li>
    <li>
      After 15 minutes, flip the chicken pieces over and spoon the glaze over them. Let the chicken cook for a further 10 - 15 minutes. Then remove from the oven and let them cool down.
    </li>
    <li>
      Slice the chicken and set aside.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Ramen Egg or Unseasoned soft boiled egg</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make ramen eggs the day before, according to this recipe. OR make regular soft boiled eggs to top your ramen bowl. (Ramen eggs need at least 2 hours to marinate).
    </li>
    <li>
      To make regular soft boiled eggs - bring a pot of water to a boil. Lower 4 large eggs carefully into the water and cook
      the eggs for 6 - 6 ½ minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Immediately place the eggs in cool running water or an ice bath for a few minutes. Peel and set aside until ready to serve. This can be done BEFORE you cook the ramen as well.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Steamed greens</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Wash the greens, and cut them in half, or into sections if necessary (for Shanghai bok choy).
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the greens in a bowl and drizzle a little soy sauce and sesame oil (and garlic) on top. Toss to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cover and microwave in 1 minute increments until the greens have softened, but not too wilted. Alternatively, you can heat a non-stick pan with a little oil, and pan fry the greens with soy sauce and garlic for about 2 – 4 minutes.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>To Serve</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Evenly divide the hot stock between the four bowls with ramen noodles.
    </li>
    <li>
      Top with the steamed greens, sliced soy chicken, ramen eggs, spring onions, radishes and other toppings you like.
     </li>
  </ol>
